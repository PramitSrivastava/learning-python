# **Python: High-Level & Interpreted Language**

---

## **1. Python as a High-Level Language**

**Definition:**
A **high-level language (HLL)** is a programming language that is **closer to human language** and **farther from machine code**, making it **easy to read, write, and understand**.

**Key Features:**

* **Human-friendly syntax:** Easy to read and write (e.g., `print("Hello World")`).
* **Hardware abstraction:** No need to manage memory or CPU instructions manually.
* **Portability:** Can run on different computers with little or no modification.
* **Needs translation:** Requires a **compiler** or **interpreter** to convert into machine code.

**Examples:**

* **Python**, **Java**, **C#**, **JavaScript**, **Ruby**

**Contrast with Low-Level Languages:**

* **Low-level languages** (Assembly, Machine Code) are **closer to hardware**, **harder to read**, but **faster in execution**.

## **2. Python as an Interpreted Language**

Python is primarily an **interpreted language**, meaning it is **executed line by line** by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.

## **3. Python Execution Flow**

### **Step 1: Write Source Code**

* File with `.py` extension, e.g.:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### **Step 2: Compilation to Bytecode (Automatic)**

* Python **automatically compiles source code into bytecode** (`.pyc`) stored in `__pycache__`.
* **Bytecode** is **platform-independent**.
* **No manual compilation** is required.

### **Step 3: Python Virtual Machine (PVM) Execution**

* PVM **interprets the bytecode line by line**.
* Handles **memory allocation, variable management, function calls, and runtime errors**.

### **Step 4: Runtime Output**

* The bytecode execution produces **output on your machine**.
* **Errors** are usually **runtime errors**, unlike Java where many are caught during compilation.

## **5. Key Points to Remember**

* **Compilation happens automatically** → no separate step needed.
* **Bytecode is platform-independent** → runs on any system with Python installed.
* **Execution is interpreted** → line-by-line via PVM.
* **Slower than compiled languages** like Java.
* **Errors appear mostly at runtime.**
